		//you can only access it within the same class

		// in private class we can not execute the codes in other package in the same -

				// Class : 
		// Class is a blueprint / class is a template (usually has not values)
		// it is design of something (template) usually blank
		
				// Object : 
		//instance of a class / its a copy the class (will have the values)
		//we can use the class name and change the details in it over and over
				//
				 // class is the template and object is what you create from the template
