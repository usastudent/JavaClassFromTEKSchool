		 * 1) Interface
		 * 2) Abstract Class

		/*
		 * 1) interface is basically a contract. the thing that a class should have.
		 * the job is to just define the list of things that you have to know.
		 * 
		 * in interface we can have only abstract method, and static final method.
		 * 
		 * the implements keyword : inherits the code form interface to the class.
		 * the difference between Extends and Implements is that the Implements forced you 
		 * to override what code you are getting.
		 * 
		 * it gives this ability that all the classes can inherit the codes 
		 * you have in interface and then rewrite them regarding their needs .
		 * 
		 * Interface is not a class.
		 * Interface will not tell you how the function is working.
		 * In Interface we define the methods that the class must have.
		 * Classed can have their own methods and Interface codes together.
		 * interface will not define how these items should work , 
		 * it will just say that the class must have these items.
		 * Ususally Interfaces stand on the top of frame work.

		/*
		 * Inheritance vs Abstraction
		 * inheritance give you a copy of that but Abstraction define the things , metods
		 * Abstraction give you a short of list that you need to make
		 */
		
		/*
		 * we can extends Interfaces ( inherit them ).
		 * a Class can not extend interface but it can implement from Interface.
		 */
		
		/*
		 * in project we have interfaces and classes 
		 * interfaces stand on the top , and provide the common codes to the classes.
		 * Interfaces provided certain rules that classes can use them through implement.
